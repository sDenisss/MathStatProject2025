# 📊 Math Statistics Project (C# Console App)

This project is a simple console application written in **C#** for calculating basic statistical measures from a numeric dataset.

It was developed as part of the **"Mathematical Statistics"** university course.

## 📌 Features

- Mean (average)
- Variance
- Standard deviation
- Range
- Median
- Mode
- Interval grouping
- Frequency tables
- And many other

---

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to input a dataset (usually numbers separated by spaces or commas).
2. It calculates and prints various statistical characteristics.
3. Grouped intervals and frequencies are also calculated and displayed.

And about Project

# ⚽ Football Match Stats Analyzer

This is a **C# console project** where I parse football match data from a website and analyze how in-game statistics (shots, possession, fouls, etc.) affect a team's chances of winning.

The goal of this project was to explore the correlation between match statistics and game outcomes using real data(FIFA WORLD CUP 2022).

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Parses match data from a website (HTML content).
- Extracts key statistics: shots, possession and e.g.
- Compares the stats of both teams.
- Identifies which factors are most commonly present in wins.

---

## 🧠 What It Analyzes

For each match, the following are checked:

- Which team had more:
  - Shots
  - Possession
  - and other

- Did the team with more of each stat **win**?

At the end, a summary is shown with win/loss outcomes based on each stat.

🛠 Technologies
 - C# (.NET)
 - HTML parsing (manual / regex / string processing)
 - Basic statistical summarization

📚 Project Purpose
This was done as part of a Math Statistics assignment at ITMO University (2025).
It combines programming, data extraction, and basic analytics.

🚀 Possible Improvements
 - Use an HTML parser like HtmlAgilityPack
 - Export results to CSV
 - Visualize data with charts
